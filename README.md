# HW05A/B
## HW05A - Keeping Track of Time

An interesting clock based on HSL. 

The smallest unit "l" will change each 0.1 s. For smoother transition, both "s" and "l" change from 0 to 100 back and forth. Whether incrementing or decrementing, when the smaller unit completes 100 units of change, the next larger unit will accordingly advance by one.

Overall, this is a color clock with a cycle of 100 hours.
